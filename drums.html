            <h2>Side Drums</h2>
            <p>
                Side drums, also known as snare drums, are shallow drums with a strong, crisp sound. They are typically played with drumsticks and are an essential part of marching bands. The sound is characterized by the presence of snares, which are metal wires stretched across the bottom head of the drum.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Side drums provide the backbeat in music, helping to maintain the tempo and add dynamics to the performance. Their sharp, articulate sound cuts through the ensemble, allowing them to be heard clearly. They are often used for rhythmic patterns and rudiments, enhancing the overall rhythm of the band.

            <h2>Bass Drums</h2>
            <p>
                Bass drums are larger, deeper-sounding drums that provide the fundamental rhythm in a band. They are usually played with a large mallet and are crucial for maintaining the beat. In marching bands, bass drums often feature a shoulder strap for portability.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Bass drums establish the foundation of the rhythm section, producing low frequencies that give the music depth and power. They help keep time for the ensemble and are often used for accentuating downbeats. In marching bands, bass drums can also be used for visual effects during performances, with different players moving in sync to create a cohesive visual and auditory experience.

            <h2>Cymbals</h2>
            <p>
                Cymbals are percussion instruments consisting of thin, circular plates of bronze or brass. They come in various sizes and types, including crash, ride, and hi-hat cymbals, each serving a unique purpose in music.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Cymbals add texture and color to a musical performance. Crash cymbals produce a loud, explosive sound, often used for accents. Ride cymbals provide a steady rhythm, while hi-hats are used to create dynamic effects by opening and closing. Together, they enhance the overall sonic landscape of the ensemble.
