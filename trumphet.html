            <h2>Trumpets</h2>
            <p>
                Trumpets are brass instruments with a bright, powerful sound. They are widely used in various musical genres, including classical, jazz, and marching bands. The trumpet has three valves that alter the pitch by changing the length of the tubing.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Trumpets play a crucial role in both melodic and harmonic support within an ensemble. They are often used for fanfares, solos, and to add brightness to the overall sound of the band. Their ability to project sound makes them ideal for outdoor performances.

            <h2>Cornets</h2>
            <p>
                Cornets are similar to trumpets but have a more compact shape and a mellow tone. They are commonly used in brass bands and orchestras. Like trumpets, cornets have three valves and are played by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Cornets are often used for lyrical passages due to their smooth, warm sound. They blend well with other brass instruments and can provide both melody and harmony. Their design allows for easier playability in lower registers, making them versatile in various musical styles.

            <h2>Bugles</h2>
            <p>
                Bugles are brass instruments that are typically simpler than trumpets and cornets, lacking valves. They have a distinct, bright sound and are commonly used in military and marching bands. The bugle is often associated with calls and signals rather than complex melodies.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Bugles are primarily used for signaling and fanfares. Their design makes them ideal for producing clear, loud notes that can be heard over long distances. While they do not have the versatility of trumpets or cornets, bugles play a vital role in military ceremonies and marching performances.

            <h2>Euphoniums</h2>
            <p>
                Euphoniums are brass instruments that produce a rich, warm sound, often described as the "voice" of the brass section. They are larger than trumpets and cornets, with a conical shape that allows for a smooth, lyrical tone. Euphoniums typically have three or four valves to alter pitch.
            </p>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                Euphoniums are known for their versatility, often used in concert bands, brass bands, and orchestras. They can perform both melodic lines and harmonic support. Their mellow tone makes them excellent for lyrical passages, and they often take on solo roles within ensembles.
